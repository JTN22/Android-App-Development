# 🎶 Case Project: Celtic Songs App

**📝 Application Title:** Celtic Songs App  
**🎯 Purpose:** This music app compares and plays different types of Celtic music.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The app launches with a splash screen showing the `celtic.png` image and the title “Celtic Sounds” for 4 seconds.  
2. Two music types are available:  
   - `jig.mp3`: Plays while displaying an image of Irish dancers (`jig.png`)  
   - `bagpipes.mp3`: Plays while showing an image of a man playing bagpipes (`bagpipe.png`)

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- All media files (`jig.mp3`, `bagpipes.mp3`, and the images) are provided with your student files.  
- Music can be played and paused via a button.  
- Only one play button is visible at a time—hide the other when one song is playing.
