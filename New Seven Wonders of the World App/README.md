# 🏛️ Case Project: New Seven Wonders of the World App

**📝 Application Title:** New Seven Wonders of the World (Monuments)  
**🎯 Purpose:** Wikipedia would like an app to showcase the new Seven Wonders of the World. Users can tap on each monument to see a larger image and learn its name.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The opening screen shows a **GridView** of seven images, each representing a New Wonder of the World:  
   - Great Wall of China, Petra, The Redeemer, Machu Picchu, Chichén Itzá, Colosseum, and Taj Mahal  
2. When the user taps a monument image:  
   - A larger version of the selected image appears below the grid  
   - A toast message shows which monument was selected by number

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use the provided images named `wonder1` through `wonder7`  
- Display **four images per row** using GridView  
- Use a **column width of 60dp**, and **3dp spacing** horizontally and vertically
