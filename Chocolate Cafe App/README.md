# 🍫 Case Project: Chocolate Cafe App

**📝 Application Title:** Chocolate Cafe App  
**🎯 Purpose:** A café specializing in chocolate desserts named *Chocolatl* would like an app that highlights its dessert specials of the day. When a special is selected, the corresponding image is displayed.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The opening screen displays three dessert specials of the day and shows a custom icon linking to the full website.  
2. When the user selects a dessert (chocolate mousse, chocolate cake, or chocolate macaron):  
   - The related dessert image is displayed.  
   - If the "full website" is selected, open: [http://www.chocolatiernl.com](http://www.chocolatiernl.com)

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use a launcher icon named `ic_launcher_dessert.png`  
- Use the provided images: `mousse.png`, `cake.png`, and `macaron.png`  
- Design a custom layout similar to Figure 5-33  
- Use the `Switch` decision structure  
- Use a `String` table to manage image descriptions
