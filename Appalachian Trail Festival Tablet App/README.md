# 🏞️ Case Project: Appalachian Trail Festival Tablet App

**📝 Application Title:** Appalachian Trail Festival Tablet App  
**🎯 Purpose:** The Appalachian Trail Festival wants an Android tablet app that shows a title and event description. When users tap a button, a calendar pops up for reserving a ticket to the festival. The selected date is then shown as reserved.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The opening screen on the tablet displays:  
   - An image  
   - A title  
   - An event description  
   - A button to open the reservation dialog  
2. When the user taps the button:  
   - A **DatePicker** appears in a dialog  
   - The dialog allows users to select a date for the festival

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use the provided image `hike.png`  
- Write your own event description  
- Research and apply the hexadecimal color for **red**  
- Use the **Theme.Black** theme  
- Layout design must include a **TableLayout with four rows**, wrapped in a **LinearLayout**

> 📚 *Note: This app is from the 3rd edition (2016) of "Android Boot Camp for Developers Using Java" by Corinne Hoisington. You may need to adjust the layout or theme for modern Android devices.*
