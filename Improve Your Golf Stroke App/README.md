# 🏌️‍♂️ Case Project: Improve Your Golf Stroke App

**📝 Application Title:** Improve Your Golf Stroke App  
**🎯 Purpose:** This app uses **Frame animation** to demonstrate the correct positions during a golf swing using a series of instructional images.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The app displays **six images** representing key stages of a golf swing.  
   - When the user taps the **"ROTATE YOUR SWING"** button, a **Frame animation** is triggered  
   - Each image appears for **0.5 seconds**, forming a smooth animation  
2. When the button is tapped:  
   - The **fifth image** rotates **nine times** (270 degrees each) at **3-second intervals**, simulating a dynamic swing rotation.

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use the images `golf1` through `golf6`  
- Set each image to size: **700 x 1000**
