# 🛏️ Case Project: Youth Hostel App
 
**📝 Application Title:** Youth Hostel App  
**🎯 Purpose:** In a youth hostel reservations app, a hostel is selected and an address and other information are displayed.  
**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The opening screen displays the name of a hostel, an image, and a button. Research a real hostel name, address, and cost range to display in your customized app.  
2. When the user selects a hostel, an address and a cost range are displayed in a second screen.  

> 📚 *Note: This case project is based on the 3rd edition (2016) of "Android Boot Camp for Developers Using Java" by Corinne Hoisington. Hostel names, prices, and locations may have changed since then. Feel free to research and use current hostel data for a more relevant experience.*
