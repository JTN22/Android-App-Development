# 📱 Case Project: Large Tech Companies

**📝 Application Title:** Large Tech Companies  
**🎯 Purpose:** In the Large Tech Companies app, the present top five technology companies in the world are displayed.  
**🧠 Algorithms:** The opening screen displays the present top five world technology companies separated by a comma. Please research this topic and order them based on revenue. The current companies may not be in the same order.  

> 📚 *Note: This case project is based on the 3rd edition (2016) of "Android Boot Camp for Developers Using Java" by Corinne Hoisington. Since the tech landscape evolves rapidly, the listed companies may no longer reflect the current top five by revenue. Users are encouraged to update the list using the most recent data.*
