# 🚖 Case Project: Chicago Cab Fare App

**📝 Application Title:** Chicago Cab Fare App  
**🎯 Purpose:** Create an app that estimates the cost for cab fare in Chicago. The app calculates the cost of the trip and allows the user to request a reservation for a smart car, traditional sedan, or minivan.  
**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The app requests the distance in miles for the cab ride and your preference for the cab type. Available options: smart car, traditional sedan, or minivan.  
   - Base fare: $3.00  
   - Mileage rate: $3.25 per mile  
2. The app displays the name of a cab company, a picture of a logo, and the calculated fare for the selected cab type.
