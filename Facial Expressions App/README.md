# 😀 Case Project: Facial Expressions App

**📝 Application Title:** Facial Expressions App  
**🎯 Purpose:** This app uses **Frame animation** to display a sequence of facial expressions from an actor, demonstrating emotion and movement through images.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The app opens with the **first image** of a man showing a happy facial expression.  
2. When the user taps the **"SEE THE ACTOR"** button:  
   - All **seven facial expressions** are displayed  
   - Each image is shown for **2 seconds**  
   - After the final image, the animation ends

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use the provided images: `face1` through `face7`  
- Each image should only appear once in the animation sequence

> 📚 *Note: This project is based on the 3rd edition (2016) of "Android Boot Camp for Developers Using Java" by Corinne Hoisington. Adjust image quality or animation timing as needed for modern devices.*
