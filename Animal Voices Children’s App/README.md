# 🐖 Case Project: Animal Voices Children’s App

**📝 Application Title:** Animal Voices Children’s App  
**🎯 Purpose:** This fun app plays the sounds of cows and pigs in the barnyard to engage children with animal sounds.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The splash screen displays an image of a farm and the title **"Animal Voices"** for six seconds.  
2. The next screen presents two buttons with images:  
   - One plays a **cow sound** (`cows.mp3`) and shows `cows.png`  
   - The other plays a **pig sound** (`pigs.mp3`) and shows `pigs.png`

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use `cows.png`, `pigs.png`, `cows.mp3`, and `pigs.mp3` from your student files.  
- Each sound effect should toggle play/pause on user tap.  
- Only one sound can play at a time—hide the other button when one is active.
