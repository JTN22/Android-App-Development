# 📷 Case Project: Phone Photo Prints App

**📝 Application Title:** Phone Photo Prints App  
**🎯 Purpose:** This app determines the cost of printing photos from your phone. The printed pictures are delivered directly to your home.  

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The opening screen requests the number of photos to print from the user’s phone.  
2. The user selects a radio button to print either:  
   - 4 x 6 prints: $0.19 each (up to 5 prints), or  
   - 8 x 10 prints: $0.79 each (up to 5 prints), then taps the **Order Prints** button.  
3. The cost is displayed based on the selected print type and quantity.

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- The result is rounded to the nearest penny.  
- Maximum: 50 prints.  
- Use a theme with an Action Bar and custom Action Bar icon.  
- Use a custom launcher icon: `ic_launcher_photo.png`
