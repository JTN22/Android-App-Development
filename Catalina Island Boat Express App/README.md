# ⛴️ Case Project: Catalina Island Boat Express App

**📝 Application Title:** Catalina Island Boat Express App  
**🎯 Purpose:** Catalina Express has 30 daily departures between Long Beach and Catalina Island. This app determines how many boat tickets the user needs and whether the trip is to Catalina Island or back to Long Beach. It displays the total fare for a one-way trip.  
**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The app displays a title, an image, a `TextField`, `Spinner`, and `Button` control.  
   - Spinner options: "To Catalina Island" and "To Long Beach"  
   - Each one-way passenger ticket: **$34**  
2. When the user taps the button, the app displays the number of tickets and the total fare.
