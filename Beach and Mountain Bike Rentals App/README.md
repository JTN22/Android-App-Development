# 🚲 Case Project: Beach and Mountain Bike Rentals App

**📝 Application Title:** Beach and Mountain Bike Rental App  
**🎯 Purpose:** This app simulates a bike rental shop and displays information about beach and mountain bike rental services. When a bike is selected, the app shows a rental bike image.

**🧠 Algorithms:**  
1. The opening screen displays a list of bikes for rent:  
   - Beach bikes  
   - Mountain bikes  
   - Link to a full bike rental shop website  
2. When the user selects an item from the list:  
   - A full-screen image of the selected bike appears (for the first two options).  
   - The third option opens http://www.campusbikeshop.com in a web browser.

**⚙️ Conditions:**  
- Use provided images: `beach.png` and `mountain.png`.  
- Use the built-in layout: `simple_list_item_1`.  
- Implement logic using the `Switch` statement.  
- Use a `String` variable to store image descriptions.
